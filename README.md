Simulating 8 datasets which either conform/disconform to the assumptions of a Linear Regression model. Measuring the results and applying bootstrapping to see whether the results are improved.

Note : Train/Test splits have been done to measure the Mean Square Errors, though it is assumed that spliiting/non-splitting won't affect the results as the data has been simulated(comes from the same population) and the data is bigh enough for the study
