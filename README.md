Simulating 8 datasets that either conform/disconfirm to the assumptions of a Linear Regression model are tested for their predictability/accuracy.

Note : Train/Test splits have been done to measure the Mean Square Errors/R2, though it is assumed that spliiting/non-splitting won't affect the results as the data has been simulated(comes from the same population) and the data is large for the study
